kafka-docker
============

Dockerfile for [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/)

The image is available directly from https://registry.hub.docker.com/

##Pre-Requisites

- install docker-compose [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- modify the ```KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME``` in ```docker-compose.yml``` to match your docker host IP (Note: Do not use localhost or 127.0.0.1 as the host ip if you want to run multiple brokers.)
- if you want to customise any Kafka parameters, simply add them as environment variables in ```docker-compose.yml```, e.g. in order to increase the ```message.max.bytes``` parameter set the environment to ```KAFKA_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES: 2000000```. To turn off automatic topic creation set ```KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE: 'false'```

##Usage

Start a cluster:

- ```docker-compose up -d ```


Add more brokers:

- ```docker-compose scale kafka=3```

Destroy a cluster:

- ```docker-compose stop```

##Note

The default ```docker-compose.yml``` should be seen as a starting point. By default each broker will get a new port number and broker id on restart. Depending on your use case this might not be desirable. If you need to use specific ports and broker ids, modify the docker-compose configuration accordingly, e.g. [docker-compose-single-broker.yml](https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker/blob/master/docker-compose-single-broker.yml):

- ```docker-compose -f docker-compose-single-broker.yml up```

##Automatically create topics

If you want to have kafka-docker automatically create topics in Kafka during
creation, a ```KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS``` environment variable can be
added in ```docker-compose.yml```.

Here is an example snippet from ```docker-compose.yml```:

        environment:
          KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS: "Topic1,Topic2"

NOTE: All topics will be created with a single partition and a single replica
